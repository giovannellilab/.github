My group aims to explore and understand the emergence and evolution of life and the co-evolution of the Geosphere and the Biosphere.

Our current work lays at the interface between microbial ecology, microbial evolution and geochemistry. We integrate classic microbiology techniques with cutting-the-edge molecular and computational tools in order to investigate the role of microbes in shaping the environment, their interactions with abiotic factors and the drivers of evolution and adaptation.
